# Note: flakes lists for CI are just a list of lines that, when
# non-zero-length and not starting with '#', will regex match to
# delete lines from the test list.  Be careful.

# Flakes reported more than once during Jan-Feb 2020
dEQP-GLES31.functional.layout_binding.ssbo.fragment_binding_array

# This started failing, despite passing locally (and generating identical
# cmdstream as before.  Not sure what is going on, but adding it to skips
# for now
dEQP-GLES31.functional.compute.shared_var.atomic.compswap.lowp_int

# Non-sysmem flakes
dEQP-VK.pipeline.spec_constant.compute.composite.matrix.mat3x2

# Fails NIR_VALIDATE so probably flaky
dEQP-VK.memory_model.write_after_read.core11.u32.coherent.fence_fence.atomicwrite.workgroup.payload_nonlocal.workgroup.guard_local.buffer.comp

# At least some of the separate_channels tests fail on sysmem due to an
# interaction of use of a UBWC buffer as both a render target and a
# texture.  Stores are done through both paths in separate channels,
# and the UBWC updates don't get synced.  The current a650 blob also
# fails these tests and qcom apparently noted the failure at one point
# https://gitlab.khronos.org/Tracker/vk-gl-cts/-/issues/2017
